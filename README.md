## Getting Started
Express JS, dotenve and nodemon.

<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
* A server built using Express JS.
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
* 06-21-2022 11:30pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.

* 06-22-2022 11:50pm - Created a class for Forecast with the properties of date and description. Added a try / catch to return errors. Installed Axios. Added the Weatherbit API key to my .env. Attempted to grab data using the Weatherbit API and rendering it to my site by adding to my GET.

* 06-23-2022 11:30pm - Got my back end to render a 5-day forecast to my front end using the Weatherbit API. Started working on pulling data from the movie database api in the back end and rendering it on the front end.

* 06-24-2022 6:45pm - Attempted to get Movies API data to render on my front end by setting up the route and class.

<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. -->
